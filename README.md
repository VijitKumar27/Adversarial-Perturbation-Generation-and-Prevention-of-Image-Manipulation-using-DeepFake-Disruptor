# Adversarial-Perturbation-Generation-and-Prevention-of-Image-Manipulation-using-DeepFake-Disruptor

The software being developed by us is to prevent the manipulation of source images and protect them from becoming deepfakes. Deepfakes have seen a meteoric rise in popularity and this must be mitigated. Major features of the software include adding perturbations to images while maintaining their resolution and clarity. These perturbations are imperceptible to the human eye and, when passed through a Deepfake generator algorithm, would destroy the image, providing incoherent and suboptimal output. Through this more information concerning the image is provided and one can question the authenticity of the image. This will prevent images from being spoofed and will slowly work towards mitigating the threat of deepfakes.

Furthermore, implementing this software on social media sites and services where eminent personalities are present will ensure the safety and authenticity of images. In addition, the software will provide information and question the authenticity of images if they are suspected to be deepfakes, thus preventing further spoofed images and slowly mitigating the threat of deepfakes. Overall, it is important to recognize the potential danger that Deepfakes pose to society and to take proactive measures to prevent their creation.
